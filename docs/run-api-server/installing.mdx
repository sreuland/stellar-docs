To install Horizon, you have a few choices. You can...

- install prebuilt binaries [from our repositories](#package-manager) via your package manager if running a Debian-based system,
- download a [prebuilt release](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases/latest) of Horizon for your target architecture and operation system, or
- [build Horizon and Stellar Core yourself](#building) from scratch.
- use [horizon helm chart](https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/horizon/README.md) which internally uses same prebuilt binary in the runtime image.

**prebuilt binaries method is recommended**: Not only do you ensure OS compatibility and dependency management, you'll also install some convenient wrappers that make running Horizon and Stellar Core in their respective environments much simpler.

## Installation Methods

### Package Manager

SDF publishes new releases to its custom Ubuntu repositories. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system.md#adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system) to add the stable SDF repository to your system. [This page](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/installing-individual-packages.md#installing-individual-packages) outlines the various commands that these packages make available. We'll need:

<CodeExample>

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stellar-horizon stellar-core
```

</CodeExample>

## Helm Chart Installation

If the deployment can be done on Kubernetes, there is a [horizon helm chart](https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/horizon) available. Install the [Helm cli tool](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), if you haven't already on your workstation, minimum of version 3. Next, add the Stellar repo to the helm client's list of repos used to find installable charts:

<CodeExample>

```bash
helm repo add stellar https://helm.stellar.org/charts
helm repo update stellar
```

</CodeExample>

Don't install the horizon helm chart yet, it will be done in [Running](./running.mdx), but you should review [Configuring](./configuring.mdx) first to be aware of all the potential horizon configuration parameters which the chart auto-configures by default.

If kubernetes is not an option, the helm charts may still be good reference for showing how to configure and run the horizon docker container. Just run the helm command with `template` to display the generated kubeneretes manifests which demonstrate all the container configurations needed:

<CodeExample>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts; cd helm-charts
helm template -f charts/horizon/values.yaml charts/horizon/
```

</CodeExample>

Next, you can jump to [Testing Your Installation](#completing-and-testing-your-installation).

### Building

Should you decide not to use one of our prebuilt releases, you may instead build Horizon from source. To do so, you need to prepare a developer environment, including:

- A Unix-like operating system with the common core commands (cp, tar, mkdir, bash, etc.)
- A compatible distribution of [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) (v1.15 or later)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

_(Though Horizon can run on Windows, *building* directly on Windows is not supported.)_

At this point, you can easily build the Horizon binary:

<CodeExample>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/go monorepo && cd monorepo
go install -v ./services/horizon
```

</CodeExample>

_(You should refer to the list of [Horizon releases](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases) and `git checkout` accordingly before building if you're looking for a stable release rather than the bleeding edge `master` branch.)_

At this point, you can either copy the binary from the `GOPATH` to the system PATH (as [we'll do later](#completing-and-testing-your-installation)), or add Go binaries to your PATH in your `.bashrc` (or equivalent):

<CodeExample>

```bash
export PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH
```

</CodeExample>

You will also need to compile Stellar Core from its source code if you need ingestion or transaction submission. You should refer to [their installation guide](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for details.

Next, jump ahead to [Testing Your Installation](#completing-and-testing-your-installation).

## Completing and Testing Your Installation

If you [built from source](#building) or downloaded a release [from GitHub](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases), make sure to copy the native binary into a directory that is part of your PATH. Most Unix-like systems have `/usr/local/bin` in PATH by default, so unless you have a preference or know better, we recommend you copy the binary there:

<CodeExample>

```bash
sudo cp horizon /usr/local/bin/stellar-horizon
```

</CodeExample>

_(We've renamed it here to keep it consistent with the results of the recommended [Package Manager](#package-manager) method.)_

To test your installation, simply run `stellar-horizon --help` from a terminal. If the help for Horizon is displayed, your installation was successful.

**Note**: Some shells (such as [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)) cache PATH lookups. You may need to clear your cache (by using `rehash` in zsh, for example) or restart your shell before trying to run the aforementioned command.
