To install Horizon in production or non-development environments, we recommend the following based on target infrastructure:

- bare-metal:
  - if host is debian linux, install prebuilt binaries [from repositories](#package-manager) using package manager.
  - for any other hosts, download [prebuilt release binaries](#prebuilt-releases) of Stellar Horizon and Core for host target architecture and operation system.
- containerized:
  - non-Helm Chart, if the target envrironment for container to run does not support Helm chart usage, run the prebuilt docker image of Horizon published on [dockerhub.com/stellar/horizon](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-horizon).
  - Helm charts, when the target envrionment uses container orchestration such as Kubernetes and has enabled Helm Charts on cluster. The [Horizon Helm chart](https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/horizon) manages installation life cycle. Use the [Helm Install command](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/), it will accept Horizon's configuration parameters. Please review [Configuration](./configuring.mdx) first, to identify any specific configuration params needed.

For installation in development environments, please refer to the [Horizon README](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/README.md#try-it-out) from the source code repo for options to use in development context.

### Notes

#### Package Manager

SDF publishes new releases to its custom Ubuntu repositories. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system.md#adding-the-sdf-stable-repository-to-your-system) to add the stable SDF repository to your host system and [Install package](https://github.com/stellar/packages/blob/master/docs/installing-individual-packages.md#installing-individual-packages) outlines the various commands that these packages make available. To proceed with installation:

<CodeExample>

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stellar-horizon stellar-core
```

</CodeExample>

#### Prebuilt Releases

Refer to the list of [Horizon releases](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases) and [Core releases](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases). Copy the binaries to host PATH.

#### Verify bare metal installations

Run `stellar-horizon --help` from a terminal. If the help for Horizon is displayed, your installation was successful.

Some shells (such as [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)) cache PATH lookups. You may need to clear your cache (by using `rehash` in zsh, for example) or restart your shell before trying to run the aforementioned command.

## Next Step

After installation is complete, you are now ready to proceed to [Configuring Horizon](./configuring.mdx)!
