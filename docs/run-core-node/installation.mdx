There are multiple ways to install Stellar Core: you can use a Docker image, pre-built packages, helm-chart, or build from source. To help choose which to use, first identify the deployment goal of [development](./installation.mdx#development-environments) or [production](./installation.mdx#production-environments) which determines best option to use.

Regardless of installation choice, you should make sure to install the latest [release](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases) since releases are cumulative and backwards compatible.

The version number scheme that we follow is `protocol_version.release_number.patch_number` where:

`protocol_version` is the maximum protocol version supported by that release (all versions are 100% backward compatible), `release_number` is bumped when a set of new features or bug fixes not impacting the protocol are included in the release, `patch_number` is used when a critical fix has to be deployed.

### Development environments

#### Quickstart Image

Using the Quickstart image is the quickest and easiest method, so it's a good choice for a lot of developers. SDF maintains the [quickstart image](https://github.com/stellar/docker-stellar-core-horizon) which bundles Stellar Core with Horizon and postgreSQL databases. It's a quick way to set up a default, non-validating, ephemeral configuration that should work for most developers.

In addition to SDF images, Satoshipay maintains separate Docker images for [Stellar Core](https://github.com/satoshipay/docker-stellar-core). The Satoshipay Stellar Core Docker image comes in a few flavors, including one with the AWS CLI installed and one with the Google Cloud SDK installed.

#### Installing from source

If you want to sacrifice convenience for maximum control, build from source. See the [install from source](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for build instructions.

### Production environments

When running Stellar Core in production, you should consider the following deployment options: [docker image](./installation.mdx#docker-image), [helm chart](./installation.mdx#helm-chart), or [linux package](./installation.mdx#linux-package).

#### Docker Image

The SDF maintains a Stellar-Core-only [standalone image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/stellar/stellar-core).

Example usage:

```
docker run stellar/stellar-core:latest help
docker run stellar/stellar-core:latest gen-seed
```

To run daemon you need to provide a configuration file:

```
# Initialize postgres DB (see DATABASE config option)
docker run -v "/path/to/config/dir:/etc/stellar/" stellar/stellar-core:latest new-db
# Run stellar-core daemon in the background
docker run -d -v "/path/to/config/dir:/etc/stellar/" stellar/stellar-core:latest run
```

The image utilizes deb packages so it's possible to confirm checksum of the stellar-core binary in the docker image matches that in the cryptographically signed deb package. See [packages](https://github.com/stellar/packages/) documentation for information on installing Ubuntu packages. To calculate checksum in the docker image you can run:

```
docker run --entrypoint=/bin/sha256sum stellar/stellar-core:latest /usr/bin/stellar-core
```

#### Linux Package

If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later, we provide the latest stable releases of [stellar-core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core) and [stellar-horizon](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/horizon) in Debian binary package format.

You may choose to install these packages individually, which offers the greatest flexibility but requires **manual** creation of the relevant configuration files and configuration of a **PostgreSQL** database.

#### Helm Chart

If the deployment can be done on Kubernetes, there is a [core helm chart](https://github.com/stellar/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/core) available. Install the [Helm cli tool](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), minimum of version 3, if you haven't already on your workstation. Next, add the Stellar repo to the helm client's list of repos, and view the available chart versions:

<CodeExample>

```bash
helm repo add stellar https://helm.stellar.org/charts
helm repo update stellar
helm search repo stellar/core --versions
```

</CodeExample>

Don't install the core helm chart yet, it will be done in [Running](./running-node.mdx), but you should review [Configuring](./configuring.mdx) first to be aware of all the potential configuration parameters which can be automatatically set by chart or manually overridden.

If kubernetes is not an option, the helm charts may still be good reference for showing how to configure and run the core docker container. Just run the helm command with `template` to display the generated kubeneretes manifests which demonstrate all the container configurations needed:

<CodeExample>

```bash
helm template my-core-deployment stellar/core/ --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stellar/helm-charts/main/charts/core/values.yaml
```

</CodeExample>
